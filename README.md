# Citizen Coin

Community Currency for Citizens

This is an experiment.

What if we could create a currency to organise a community of citizens working together to create and maintain a common?

We just started a temporary occupation in Schaerbeek, Brussels. It's a 1000 square meters building at the corner of our street, we call it the [Citizen Corner](https://citizencorner.brussels).

It costs money and we need to find a way to pay for it.
We also don't want to create a dedicated legal entity that would take the responsibility away from citizens.

We all need to take responsibility to make this place alive and sustainable.

By creating a crypto currency for the community, we effectively create a crypto cooperative (or DAO for Distributed Autonomous Organization) where every coin holder is a cooperator that holds in their hands a piece of the community.

## Minting coins

There is no initial supply. We create coins as debt towards citizens in the community that pay the various bills for the building.

You can buy citizen coins from anyone who already has some or buy paying one of the pending expenses of the collective.

## Paying with coins

We cannot expect every citizen to be tech savvy enough to have their own crypto wallet. That's why we are offering a paper wallet solution (the Citizen Card) that you can get at the Citizen Corner. This card can hold up to â‚¬50 worth of Citizen Coins (25 citizen coins at today's rate) and works on the same principle that the now defunct [Proton Card](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_(bank_card)>) (electronic wallet). This allows for very fast zero fees transactions at points of sale.

You can move your balance of your Citizen Card to ERC20 Citizen Coins. We use the Proof of Stake [Polygon Network](https://polygon.technology) to reduce transaction costs and energy consumption.
